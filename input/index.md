**SoCal Python** is a Los Angeles area Python enthusiast group.

We used to meet on the fourth or last Tuesday of every month at various locations throughout the city, but are currently effectively on hiatus.

Join the [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/socalpython/) to hear about future events.
