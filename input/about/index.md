Meet other local Southern Californians who love to program in Python!

All ages welcome. Socal Python enthusiasts range from UCLA/USC students to programming veterans. We all share two things in common, L.A. and Python.

Sponsors are welcome.

Recruiters are not allowed at meetups, nor do we seek any quid-pro-quo solicitation from anyone on the recruitment side of the business (sponsorship being the exception).
