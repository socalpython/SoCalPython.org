# SoCalPython.org


This is the source repo for [SoCalPython.org], the official SoCal Python website. üêç

It's built using [corvid] and below instructions rely on [just], [uv], [modd], and [devd].


## Setup

1. Install [just], [uv], [modd], and [devd]
2. Run `uv sync`


## Developing

You can run `just --list` to see all available options. Anything requiring uv should be run ‚Äúinside‚Äù it, e.g., `uv run just dev`. You can run all commands like so if you don‚Äôt want to have to actively think about it.

1. Run `uv run just dev` to start the automa-build-and-serve process
2. Go to [http://localhost:8000]
3. Make changes
4. Refresh to see changes
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as needed


## Infrastructure

The site is deployed on [Netlify] from the `main` branch of this repository. The domain is registered by [@nkantar] through [Porkbun], and SSL is provided by [Let's Encrypt].
